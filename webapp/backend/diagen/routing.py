"""Orthogonal edge routing with obstacle avoidance.

The old router picked a jog at a fixed fraction of the gap an edge crossed. On
small diagrams that is fine; on a large one it draws long horizontal runs
straight through whatever boxes happen to sit in the way, and stacks parallel
edges on the same line.

This routes on a *channel grid* instead: the candidate x/y lines are the
corridors between node boxes, and each edge is A*-searched through them. Cost
penalises length, turns, and — crucially — reusing a corridor another edge has
already taken, which is what keeps parallel connections visually separate.

The search is bounded; anything past the limits falls back to the caller's
simple route so a pathological diagram degrades instead of hanging.
